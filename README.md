Maretosi is a static site generator which aims to be flexible enough for general use without sacrificing simplicity.

It provides a built-in basic HTML template designed to be useful for most cases, though custom templates, stylesheets, and title can be specified per page via a front matter attribute.

Consult [the manual](DOCS.md) for information on usage and available options.
